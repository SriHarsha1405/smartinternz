Project Name : Monitoring Incident States for Effective Management
Category: ServiceNow Administrator
Project Description:
Our organization needs a report for the incident management process. This report will help assignment group managers monitor the current state of incidents assigned to their teams. The focus will be on incidents that are in the states of "New," "On Hold," and "In Progress." By providing this information, managers can prioritize and address issues promptly, ensuring efficient incident resolution and improving overall service quality.
